This is an unofficial and unsupported fork of devilutionX that is intended to adapt the full Diablo+Hellfire devilutionX experience to roll-back many of Hellfire's questionable changes, while improving base Diablo gameplay without significantly changing. One with delusions of grandeur may think of it as a community edition of devilutionX, but as of right now, it is (a) my inept attempt to learn C++ coupled with (b) learning GIT coupled with (c) arbitrary* changes to devilutionX.

*I fully recognize that my preferences do not by themselves make a "community" edition of anything. That is why this is just CE - a suffix intended to distinguis from the official devilutionX repo.
