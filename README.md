This is an unofficial and unsupported fork of devilutionX that is intended to adapt the full Diablo+Hellfire devilutionX experience to roll-back many of Hellfire's questionable changes, while improving the base Diablo experience without significantly changing the gameplay or aesthetics. One with delusions of grandeur may think of it as a community edition of devilutionX, but as of right now, it is 

(a) my inept attempt to learn C++ coupled with 
(b) learning GIT coupled with 
(c) arbitrary* changes to devilutionX.

*I fully recognize that my preferences do not by themselves make a "community" edition of anything. That is why this is just CE - a suffix intended to distinguish from the official devilutionX repo.
